- Programming Approaches

// When starting on the programming(Encryption) for case-project 3, I evaluated other types of
   ciphers such as Caesar and Linear Shift on encryption for comparisons. During my evaluation,
   I found out that the Caesar cipher is similar to the Vigenere cipher in a way that it involves
   its 26 possible ciphers.
